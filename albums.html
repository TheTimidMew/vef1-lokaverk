                <h2 id="Queen1">Queen 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Queen's debut album was recorded in London between 1971 and 1972 at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea studios. All but one of the tracks were produced by Queen, Roy Baker and Trident's resident producer John Anthony, with The Night Comes Down instead produced by the band and Louie Austin at De Lane Studios. The engineers for the sessions were Roy Baker, Mike Stone, Ted Sharpe and David Hentschel.

                    The cover artwork was devised by Brian, Freddie and photographer friend Douglas Puddifoot and is based upon a shot taken on stage by Puddifoot during an early Queen concert. The band members thought the image of Freddie performing beneath a lone spot-light was an appropriate cover for the first album.
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    
                    This album saw the beginning of the famous 'Nobody played synths' note, which was to become such a familiar aspect of all Queen LPs right up to 1980's The Game. The band were fed up with people mistaking their elaborate multi-tracking and innovative guitar effects for synthesizers, when in fact much of the sound was created by Brian on his guitar using the band's own equipment and pioneering recording techniques - including the John designed 'Deacy amp' which is still used to this day.
                    
                    The famous Queen Crest logo seen on the back of the first album was designed by Freddie around this time, and became a familiar sight on most of the band's product.
                    
                    Queen was released on July 13th 1973 in the UK attained Gold sales status. In America it was issued in September, with a revised pink cover replacing the usual purple one, and also reached Gold sales.
                    
                    Singles from this album: Keep Yourself Alive / Liar.

                <p>
                    Queen's second album was produced by Robin Geoffrey Cable, Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, and engineered by the ever-resourceful Mike Stone. Recorded at London's Trident Studios in August 1973, the band were at last permitted to use the studio during normal hours and, unlike the first album, take proper time to experiment with the myriad of ideas they had for new techniques, textures and sounds. Finally, Queen could record an album how they wanted, when they wanted, and without the limitations imposed upon them throughout the debut work.

                    Numerous problems beset the album's release. Not least, its completion coincided with the 1973 oil crisis and consequently government-enforced measures for energy conservation delayed its manufacture by several months. Furthermore, when the first pressing arrived in record shops, the band noticed a spelling error on the sleeve and complained persistently before it was finally corrected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    The album cover concept was based on a photograph of Marlene Dietrich that Freddie had seen, and Mick Rock was brought in to achieve a similar effect. The image has since become one of the most recognisable and frequently used of the band, and is as striking today as it was in the 1970s.
                    
                    In contrast to this iconic predominantly black portrait of Queen, the inner gatefold photograph features the band in equally grand attire, but this time dressed in white, against a white backdrop. The theme was continued inside the album too, for instead of the usual Side 1 and 2, the original Queen II LP comprised Side White and Side Black, each one representing the band members' individual song writing talents. Freddie's contributions to the album, including the majestic March Of The Black Queen, would occupy Side Black, while Roger's track for the album, and all of Brian's, including White Queen, were presented on Side White. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    John had not yet begun his song writing for Queen - his first composition would follow later in 1974, on the Sheer Heart Attack LP. The Black/White theme was a major part of Queen in 1974, not just on record or in terms of artwork and design, but on stage too, in terms of costume.
                    
                    Queen II was released on March 8th 1974, coinciding with an extensive UK tour that began at the start of the month. It would eventually climb to No 5 in the UK chart, helped considerably by constant touring, the band’s first hit single Seven Seas Of Rhye (released two weeks earlier) and their first appearances on the BBC's Top Of The Pops television show. The album gave Queen their first UK/USA Gold status LP.
                    
                    Singles from this album: Seven Seas Of Rhye / White Queen (on Queen’s First EP).

                <h2 id="NOTW">News Of The World</h2>
                <p>
                    Queen's sixth studio album was recorded between July and September 1977 at two studios, Basing Street and Wessex. The band produced the record themselves for the first time, without Roy Thomas Baker but still assisted by Mike Stone.

                    In terms of musical content, News Of The World was a significant departure from the two albums preceding it. The band spent half the time they had previously taken to record this album (roughly ten weeks) and this accounts for the comparatively sparse production and certain songs emerging with what many would describe as an under-produced sound - by Queen standards anyway.
                    
                    The album cover features a striking image of the band adapted from a painting by esteemed American science-fiction artist Frank Kelly Freas. The unsettling depiction of a giant robot plucking the four band members from a shattered auditorium, is among the most affecting of all Queen related imagery, as is a further picture inside of the robot stretching out his hand to snatch petrified fleeing audience members. The idea came from Roger who had seen a copy of an American magazine called Astounding Science, and thought that with a little adaptation it would make an excellent cover for the new Queen album. Kelly Freas loved the idea of his creation being adapted to this unlikely scenario and agreed to alter the picture to show the band members in the robot's blood-stained hand. It is among the most striking and memorable of any album artwork, and numerous worldwide singles from the LP, as well as myriad of weird and wonderful merchandise items too numerous to list, featured variations of the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    The first single released from News Of The World was the worldwide coupling of We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You, penned by Freddie and Brian respectively. Released on October 7th, the single reached No 2 in the charts and also realised a Billboard No 2 position in the USA. Although it is often said that Crazy Little Thing Called Love (1979) was Queen's first American chart topper, the Champions / Rock You single reached the top spot of Record World's chart, and thus, technically, gave the band their first American No 1. The two songs matched each other so well that in America the record company requested permission to release the single as a double A-side, and subsequently both songs were given equal airplay – giving Elektra Records their biggest selling single to date, with over two million copies sold.
                    
                    In France, the single stayed at No 1 for twelve consecutive weeks, after which, and only because no record was permitted to be No 1 for any longer than twelve weeks, the chart was published with Rock You as No 1 instead.
                    
                    A special video was filmed for We Are The Champions, directed by Derek Burbridge and shot at the New London Theatre in London on October. It featured invited members of the London-based Queen Fan Club, who later were treated to a ten song mini-concert as a thank you for their contribution. The footage was shown all around the world and remains today one of the band’s best loved and most viewed videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    For the We Will Rock You video, the band were filmed in the garden of Roger's recently acquired country home on a freezing day in January 1978, in a few minutes left over from shooting a promo for Spread Your Wings, the next single.
                    
                    The News Of The World album was released on October 28th 1977 in the UK (the same day that Queen recorded their final session for BBC radio) and on November 1st in America. For the first time, this album fared better in America than in the band's home country, reaching No 3 in the Billboard chart and No 4 in Britain.
                    
                    Singles from this album: We Are The Champions / Spread Your Wings / It’s Late.

                <h2 id="SHA">Sheer Heart Attack</h2>
                <p>
                    Queen's third studio album was recorded between July and September 1974 at four different studios in England and Wales and was produced by Queen and Roy Thomas Baker, with once again Mike Stone as engineer.

                    Somewhat of a departure from the first two albums, Sheer Heart Attack had much more of a group feel about it, a coherence not possible to achieve previously because of the erratic way in which its predecessors were recorded. The first album, for example, was famously recorded in 'downtime' with the band permitted to use Trident studios only when no one else was using it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This album by contrast was recorded without those distractions in more calm and orthodox conditions and ultimately gave rise to a strong and greatly diverse piece of work containing several of the band's best-loved classics. This was much more of an accomplishment than might be apparent, given that Brian was absent from many sessions due to contracting Hepatitis while on tour in America in May and only being available to record his guitar and vocal parts relatively late in the proceedings. It was far from ideal but none of this is evident on the final work, and more than forty years on the album remains a firm favourite among Queen devotees. It has consistently been voted in the top 5 favourite albums in fan polls.
                    
                    Sheer Heart Attack is a more pop orientated work than its two predecessors, and indeed Killer Queen was the song that provided the band with the international hit and acclaim that Seven Seas Of Rhye never quite achieved. Brian would later observe, “For some strange reason we seemed to get a rather different feel on Sheer Heart Attack because of the way we were forced to record it (referring to his illness) and even allowing for all the problems we had, none of us were really displeased with the final result. “Roger, “It's my favourite. It holds together very well. It's much more concise. It's very varied and dynamic. The different sounds were pleasing.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    Killer Queen is the best known song on the album, for which Freddie would later be awarded his first Ivor Novello award, and also featured is Stone Cold Crazy, the first Queen song credited to all four band members, and one of the very first songs the band experimented with in the earliest rehearsals and shows. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brian’s Now I’m Here is present too, which would be issued as a single, as too is John’s first composition for Queen, Misfire. Roger’s hard-paced Sheer Heart Attack, although intended for this album was never finished in time and so appeared much later - on News Of The World in 1977
                    
                    Like Queen II, the front cover image was photographed by Queen's good friend Mick Rock - the man of whom it was said, 'captured the 70s'. To achieve the unique look we see on the cover, the band members were smeared in Vaseline and then sprayed with water to achieve a very particular and some might say 'odd' look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, it had the desired effect, as the Sheer Heart Attack cover is both (cardiac) arresting and memorable.
                    
                    Sheer Heart Attack was released on November 8th 1974 and reached No 2 in the UK, achieving Gold status. It would be the first Queen album to reach the Top 20 in the USA, achieving a very impressive No 12 position and also earning Gold status.
                    
                    Singles from this album: Killer Queen / Flick Of The Wrist / Now I’m Here / Tenement Funster (on Queen’s First EP).
