                    <strong>Queen</strong> are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by <a href="./band_members.html#Freddie">Freddie Mercury</a> (lead vocals, piano),  <a href="./band_members.html#Brian">Brian May</a> (guitar, vocals), and  <a href="./band_members.html#Roger">Roger Taylor</a> (drums, vocals), later joined by <a href="./band_members.html#John">John Deacon</a> (bass).
                    Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.
                    The founding members of Queen met in west London during the late 1960s. Guitarist Brian May had built his own guitar with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 (named after Orwell's novel) the following year with singer Tim Staffell.

                    May left the group in early 1968 to focus on his degree in Physics and Infrared Astronomy at Imperial College and find a group that could write original material. He formed the group Smile with Staffell (now playing bass) and keyboardist Chris Smith.
                    To complete the line-up, May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a "Mitch Mitchell/Ginger Baker type" drummer; Roger Taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job.Smith left the group in early 1969, immediately before a gig at the Royal Albert Hall with Free and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.

                    Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, <em>Queen II</em>, in 1974. <em>Sheer Heart Attack</em> later that year and <em>A Night at the Opera</em> in 1975 brought them international success. 
                    The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which topped the UK singles chart for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album <em>News of the World</em> contained "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", which have become anthems at sporting events.

                    By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" from <em>The Game</em> (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album <em>Greatest Hits</em> is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified nine times platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 
                    Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England.

                <p>Queen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. 
                    Estimates of their record sales range from 250 million to 300 million, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. 
                    They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles, all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, they received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
